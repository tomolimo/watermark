# Watermark plugin

GLPI plugin that provides the feature of a text that can be shown over all GLPI pages.

This text is shown when current profile has the rights to modify the GLPI general configuration (menu Setup > General), and for other profiles it is not shown.

There is a possibility to force the watermark for all profiles. This can be used to inform users that they are on a Test system (for example).

version 1.1.0 is compatible with GLPI 9.5
version 2.0.0 is compatible with GLPI 10.0
